## Overview

Bedrock contains common utilities, decorators, abstract classes, tag libraries, and JavaScript modules for bootstrapping and simplifying AEM (Adobe CQ) projects.

## Goals

* Accelerate project development by defining a simple process for implementing the underlying component logic.
* Eliminate all Java scriptlets from component JSPs.
* Ensure a consistent structure and implementation pattern for all component classes.
* Isolate AEM-specific concerns (accessing the JCR, adapting Sling and AEM objects, building links) into common modules.
* Achieve a high level of code reuse both within and across AEM projects.
